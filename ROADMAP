Feature-wise:
0.5 - distutils-support: see http://docs.python.org/2/distutils/setupscript.html
0.6 - Sybilla Support:
        - integrate XML file import
0.6 - add manual Y limit option (in raw counts?)
0.6 - add zip project files (*.zpd) (DONE)
        - TODO: split large object stores in project zip file into separate files in the zip file
0.6 - check for file extension registering on windows (using exec assoc & ftype) & linux (pyxdg)
0.6 - export to Sybilla's XML format?
0.8 - split layers and interlayers in two separate parts, each with their own
      atoms, dimensions and atom relations (usually the content of both are not related to one other, check this)
      this would allow chlorite interlayers to change their dimensions based on both the iron content in the
      interlayer sheet as well as the silica sheet.
      Would require some sort of definition of how these units are stacked
    
Code-Wise:

0.4 - Move the goniometer down to the specimen level:
        - step 1: make the project goniometer argument optional
        - step 2: add a specimen-level goniometer, do not save, do not load, copy from project-level for now
        - step 2b: add GUI-related code (specimen view & controllers) -> Goniometer setup can be made a tab in the specimen view?
        - step 3: change calculation code to use specimen-level goniometer
        - step 4: make specimen accept project_goniometer kwarg, if goniometer kwarg is not set, this is used instead, should be json string?
        - step 5:
            make the specimen goniometer storable, check this works okay &
            remove the project goniometer, pop it from kwargs if passed to __init__ and pass as project_goniometer kwarg to specimen
        
0.x - check for backwards compatibility issues with pre-O.4 project files
0.x - DOCUMENTATION!
0.x - cleanse code from TODO & FIXME's
0.5 - most of the default dialog actions (confirmation ,information etc.) could also be usefull as decorators.
