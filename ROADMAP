Feature-wise:
0.6 - Sybilla Support:
        - integrate XML file import
        - export to Sybilla's XML format?
0.7 - split layers and interlayers in two separate parts, each with their own
      atoms, dimensions and atom relations (usually the content of both are not related to one other, check this)
      this would allow chlorite interlayers to change their dimensions based on both the iron content in the
      interlayer sheet as well as the silica sheet.
      Would require some sort of definition of how these units are stacked
0.8 - implement new 'charge unit' algorithm
