Introduction
============

It is possible to write scripts for PyXRD (projects). This allows anybody to
make PyXRD do things it wasn't really intended to do or to automate certain tasks.   
Parts of the official PyXRD code are scripts themselves. This tutorial will provide
an introduction on how to setup such a script.

We assume the interested reader has already made himself familiar with Python.
