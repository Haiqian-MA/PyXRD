- MLM support
    - add R3
    - add triple and quadruple layer support for R1 & R2
- change goniometer into a ObjectListStore so we can create a list of predefined 'machines' and add or delete custom ones
- move statistics to project level so multi-specimen statistics can be shown (no residual plot, but R2 for both data sets etc.)
- add custom CSDS distributions
- allow multiple phases to be exported together, as so to maintain their relatons (e.g. WAT & GLY phases)
- add more 'default' phases
