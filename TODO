- MLM support
    - when user selects components, change range of the R spinner so it can be larger then 0 if #comp > 1
    - add R2
    - add triple and quadruple layer support
- change goniometer into a ObjectListStore so we can create a list of predefined 'machines' and add or delete custom ones
- move statistics to project level so multi-specimen statistics can be shown (no residual plot, but R2 for both data sets etc.)
- add custom CSDS distributions
