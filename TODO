- MLM support
    - add R3
    - add triple and quadruple layer support for R1 & R2
- add more 'default' phases
- default directory when Open File dialog is opened
- add custom CSDS distributions
- add manual Y limit option (in raw counts?)
- keep track of unsaved changes (flag on the project level using dirty signal?)
- ask for confirmation when closing current project with unsaved changes
- add zip project files (*.zpd)
- split large object stores in project zip file into separate files in the zip file
- export of separate phase patterns. Requires the XYListStore to be expanded so it can contain multiple y values (one for each phase, and an extra for the sum)
- move statistics to project level so multi-specimen statistics can be shown (no residual plot, but R2 for both data sets etc.)
- most of the default dialog actions (confirmation ,information etc.) could also be usefull as decorators.
- check most of the TreeView/Combobox creation code for sanity (e.g. register treeview instead of register_adapters)
- check for file extension registers on windows (using exec assoc & ftype) & linux (pyxdg)
- cleanse code from TODO & FIXME's
- ability to hide listview in objectliststore edit dialogs (slicker windows)
