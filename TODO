- MLM support
    - add R3
    - add triple and quadruple layer support for R1 & R2
- change goniometer into a ObjectListStore so we can create a list of predefined 'machines' and add or delete custom ones
- move statistics to project level so multi-specimen statistics can be shown (no residual plot, but R2 for both data sets etc.)
- add custom CSDS distributions
- add some sort of UUID's to each object, and store it in a global dict, maybe use PyXRDModel for this purpose.
